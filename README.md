# portless-webhook

**portless-webhook** is a developer-focused tool for securely receiving POST webhook requests on your local machine **without opening router ports**. It leverages secure tunnels (like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) and robust payload authentication to ensure data integrity and security. Designed to be **generic and service-agnostic**, it works seamlessly with GitHub, GitLab, Stripe, and any other service that supports webhooks.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **No Port Forwarding Required:** Receive webhooks on your local machine without exposing ports‚Äîideal for firewalled or NAT environments.
- **Payload Authentication:** HMAC signature verification with configurable algorithm and header.
- **Service Agnostic:** Works with any service that supports webhooks and HMAC signatures.
- **Plug & Play:** Minimal setup‚Äîget running in minutes.
- **Extensible:** Adapt payload handling and signature verification to your needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Biosbardos/portless-webhook.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create and Configure `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
SIGNATURE_HEADER=x-hub-signature-256   # e.g. for GitHub; change for your provider
SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM=sha256             # e.g. sha256, sha1, sha512, etc.
PORT=3000                              # (Optional) Server port, default: 3000
```

**Variable details:**
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: The secret/token configured in your webhook provider.
- `SIGNATURE_HEADER`: HTTP header where the webhook provider sends the signature.
- `SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM`: Hash algorithm (e.g., `sha256`, `sha1`).
- `PORT`: Port for the local server.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Server

```bash
node PortlessWebhook.js
```

Your server will listen on the configured `PORT` (default: 3000).

---

## üåê Expose with ngrok (or Similar)

To make your local server reachable from the internet, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/):

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/webhook`).  
Use this URL as the webhook endpoint in your external service.

---

## üí° Usage Examples

### GitHub

1. In GitHub, set your webhook secret.
2. Set `.env`:
    - `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Your secret.
    - `SIGNATURE_HEADER`: `x-hub-signature-256`
    - `SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM`: `sha256`
3. Use your ngrok HTTPS URL as the webhook endpoint.

### Stripe

1. In Stripe, set your webhook secret.
2. Set `.env` accordingly (see Stripe docs for header/algorithm).
3. Use your ngrok HTTPS URL as the webhook endpoint.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Payload Processing

Edit the `/webhook` route handler in `PortlessWebhook.js`  to process, store, or forward payloads as needed.

### Signature Verification

Signature verification logic is easily adjustable to match specific provider requirements (e.g., different header or signature formats).

---

## üîí Security Considerations

- Signature verification: Only requests with a valid HMAC signature (using your secret and algorithm) are accepted.
- Timing-attack proof: The server uses a constant-time comparison to mitigate timing attacks.
- No open router ports: Your local machine is never directly exposed in the internet.
- Customizable: Adapt signature verification to your provider‚Äôs requirements.
- **NEVER EXPOSE YOUR NGROK (or other secure tunnel provider) ENDPOINT PUBLICY.** Share it only with trusted sources.
